### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page. If you look around you'll see that I've added some repositories and [gists](https://gist.github.com/matthewgotham) to showcase work that I've done for the Department for Education-funded [Data Science Bootcamp](https://blog.hyperiondev.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Data-Science-Syllabus-DfE.pdf) that I will soon complete (God willing). You can also check out [my personal website](https://matthewgotham.github.io/) for more information. I am an aspiring data scientist with a background in academic research, specifically in languages and linguistics.
